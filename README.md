Predicting 911 based on Bostin 911 calls data using Logistic Regression and Decison Tree

In this project we are going to work on Boston 911 calls data set from Analyze Boston website.Crime incident reports are provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred. Records in the new system begin in June of 2015
